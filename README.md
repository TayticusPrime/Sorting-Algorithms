# Sorting-Algorithms

## About

The following repository contains an implementation displaying a graphical representation of several common sorting algorithms. It provides a random list of elements whose values are displayed by height. The user is able to select the desired sorting algorithm and view the algorithm sort the elements via a step-by-step animation. Its purpose is to allow users to gain a more intuitive understanding of common sorting algorithms by allowing them to visually see how data is managed in several algorithms, as well as experience the differences in speed performance between them.

## Usage

Access the web-interface: [https://tayticusprime.github.io/Sorting-Algorithms/](https://tayticusprime.github.io/Sorting-Algorithms/)

`DROPDOWN - Algorithm` – Choose which algorithm to visualize (e.g., BubbleSort, QuickSort, MergeSort, etc.)  
`SIZE` – Set how many elements to include in the array (1–999)  
`GENERATE` – Creates a new randomized list of bars based on the selected array size  
`RESET` – Restores the current array to its original unsorted state  
`SORT` – Begins the sorting animation using the algorithm selected in the dropdown  
`SPEED - Slider` – Adjust the animation speed (move right for faster, left for slower)

Typical flow:

1. Select a sorting algorithm.
2. Set the desired array size and speed.
3. Click `GENERATE` to create a new random array.
4. Click `SORT` to start the visualization.
5. Use `RESET` to restore the unsorted array and try again.
